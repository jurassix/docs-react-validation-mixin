# Overview

_Simple validation library for React._

This library simply wraps your React Component, transfering it props containing the boilerplate to validate a React form.

**react-validation-mixin** aims to provide a low-level toolkit for _React.Component_ validation, relying on existing validation libraries.

This library currently supports a single strategy _joi-validation-strategy_ but the community is urged to expand the available strategies. Each strategy is responsible for the data validation and error message responses. _A complete list of strategies will be maintained here for community reference._
